# Pokevent-Tool

This tool is used to scrape webpages for my discord bot.

## How it works

This tool works by using BeautifulSoup to scrape webpages in order to get
information about the latest PokemonGo in-game events. To select the webpage, you use the electron.js gui to select the type of event, and then
enter the link to the page. Once the information is scraped, all data is then inserted into a MySQL Database with all of the other events.
